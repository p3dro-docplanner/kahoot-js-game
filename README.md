###### 2. What's the output?

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}
```

- A: `0 1 2` and `0 1 2`
- B: `0 1 2` and `3 3 3`
- C: `3 3 3` and `0 1 2`

#### Answer: C

Because of the event queue in JavaScript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called _after_ the loop has been executed. Since the variable `i` in the first loop was declared using the `var` keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of `i` by `1` each time, using the unary operator `++`. By the time the `setTimeout` callback function was invoked, `i` was equal to `3` in the first example.

In the second loop, the variable `i` was declared using the `let` keyword: variables declared with the `let` (and `const`) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between `{ }`). During each iteration, `i` will have a new value, and each value is scoped inside the loop.

###### 15. What's the output?

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, '2');
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**: we don't specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called _implicit type coercion_. **Coercion** is converting from one type into another.

In this example, JavaScript converts the number `1` into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (`1`) and a string type (`'2'`), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like `"Hello" + "World"`, so what's happening here is `"1" + "2"` which returns `"12"`.

###### 16. What's the output?

```javascript
let number = 0;
console.log(number++);
console.log(++number);
console.log(number);
```

- A: `1` `1` `2`
- B: `1` `2` `2`
- C: `0` `2` `2`
- D: `0` `1` `2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The **postfix** unary operator `++`:

1. Returns the value (this returns `0`)
2. Increments the value (number is now `1`)

The **prefix** unary operator `++`:

1. Increments the value (number is now `2`)
2. Returns the value (this returns `2`)

This returns `0 2 2`.

###### 24. What's the output?

```javascript
const obj = { 1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c' };
const set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

obj.hasOwnProperty('1');
obj.hasOwnProperty(1);
set.has('1');
set.has(1);
```

- A: `false` `true` `false` `true`
- B: `false` `true` `true` `true`
- C: `true` `true` `false` `true`
- D: `true` `true` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

All object keys (excluding Symbols) are strings under the hood, even if you don't type it yourself as a string. This is why `obj.hasOwnProperty('1')` also returns true.

It doesn't work that way for a set. There is no `'1'` in our set: `set.has('1')` returns `false`. It has the numeric type `1`, `set.has(1)` returns `true`.

###### 40. What's the output?

```javascript
[[0, 1], [2, 3]].reduce(
  (acc, cur) => {
    return acc.concat(cur);
  },
  [1, 2],
);
```

- A: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]`
- B: `[6, 1, 2]`
- C: `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`
- D: `[1, 2, 6]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`[1, 2]` is our initial value. This is the value we start with, and the value of the very first `acc`. During the first round, `acc` is `[1,2]`, and `cur` is `[0, 1]`. We concatenate them, which results in `[1, 2, 0, 1]`.

Then, `[1, 2, 0, 1]` is `acc` and `[2, 3]` is `cur`. We concatenate them, and get `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`

###### 41. What's the output?

```javascript
!!null;
!!'';
!!1;
```

- A: `false` `true` `false`
- B: `false` `false` `true`
- C: `false` `true` `true`
- D: `true` `true` `false`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`null` is falsy. `!null` returns `true`. `!true` returns `false`.

`""` is falsy. `!""` returns `true`. `!true` returns `false`.

`1` is truthy. `!1` returns `false`. `!false` returns `true`.

###### 45. What does this return?

```javascript
const firstPromise = new Promise((res, rej) => {
  setTimeout(res, 500, 'one');
});

const secondPromise = new Promise((res, rej) => {
  setTimeout(res, 100, 'two');
});

Promise.race([firstPromise, secondPromise]).then(res => console.log(res));
```

- A: `"one"`
- B: `"two"`
- C: `"two" "one"`
- D: `"one" "two"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When we pass multiple promises to the `Promise.race` method, it resolves/rejects the _first_ promise that resolves/rejects. To the `setTimeout` method, we pass a timer: 500ms for the first promise (`firstPromise`), and 100ms for the second promise (`secondPromise`). This means that the `secondPromise` resolves first with the value of `'two'`. `res` now holds the value of `'two'`, which gets logged.

###### 108. Which of these methods modifies the original array?

```javascript
const emojis = ['‚ú®', 'ü•ë', 'üòç'];

emojis.map(x => x + '‚ú®');
emojis.filter(x => x !== 'ü•ë');
emojis.find(x => x !== 'ü•ë');
emojis.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + '‚ú®');
emojis.slice(1, 2, '‚ú®');
emojis.splice(1, 2, '‚ú®');
```

- A: `All of them`
- B: `map` `reduce` `slice` `splice`
- C: `map` `slice` `splice`
- D: `splice`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

With `splice` method, we modify the original array by deleting, replacing or adding elements. In this case, we removed 2 items from index 1 (we removed `'ü•ë'` and `'üòç'`) and added the ‚ú® emoji instead.

`map`, `filter` and `slice` return a new array, `find` returns an element, and `reduce` returns a reduced value.
